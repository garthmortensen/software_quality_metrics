# Software Quality Metrics

Metrics are calculated per function, not per script, so that the user can see functions may be bloated.

- run_timestamp = time when script was executed
- filepath = path to file
- filename = file name
- file_extension = file extension
- function_name = name of currently evaluated function
- loc_total = lines of code + comments
- loc_code = lines of code
- loc_comments = lines of comments
- cyclocomplexity = total count of control flow keywords.
- len_n = total operands.
- vocab_n = total operators?
- volume_v = 
- difficulty_d = 
- effort_e = 
- implement_time_t = 
- bugs_deliver_b =
